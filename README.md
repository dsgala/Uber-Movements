# Uber-Movements

The "Uber Travel Time Series Forecasting" project is an in-depth analysis using Uber Movement's anonymized data from over ten billion trips. It aims to build accurate and robust time series models to enhance Uber Operations and meet customer needs efficiently. 

The project includes automated data download from Uber's website, thorough data cleansing and preparation, and evaluation of various modeling methodologies like ARIMA, Regression, Exponential Smoothing, TBATS, LSTM, and XGBoost. The analysis, which focuses on travel times in Los Angeles, particularly considers COVID-19's impact, addresses missing values, and includes external factors like weather and holidays. 

The findings offer recommendations for route-specific and generalized models, balancing simplicity, operational efficiency, and performance. The project is a collaborative effort, showcasing a fully automated modeling suite designed to empower Uber's operational decision-making.
